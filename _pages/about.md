Hi, I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, advised by [Prof. Suman Banerjee](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/). Prior to joining UW–Madison, I received my M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Korea University, advised by [Prof. Hyogon Kim](http://widen.korea.ac.kr). I was a visiting scholar at [Internet Systems Lab](https://netstech.org/), University of Colorado Boulder, working with [Prof. Sangtae Ha](https://netstech.org/sangtaeha/) and [Prof. Seyeon Kim](https://seralab.korea.ac.kr/about). I also studied at Carnegie Mellon University as a collaborating visitor in an AI-focused intensive program.<br>


My research interests broadly encompass **network systems** and **mobile systems**, with a focus on practical applications such as **volumetric video streaming**.


**_Actively seeking internship opportunities_** (Summer 2026) in **multimedia network systems** and **mobile systems**.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
